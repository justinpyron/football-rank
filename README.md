# Introduction
_FootballRank_ is a method for ranking football teams. It was inspired by Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm. Strength-of-schedule is a core element; it is the primary consideration that motivated its creation.

# Appendix: Underlying Math
The original PageRank algorithm can be roughly described as follows. The PageRank $x_i \in \mathbb{R}_+$ of webpage $i$ is

$$
x_i = \sum_{j \in B_i} \frac{x_j}{N_j}
$$

where $B_i = \text{the set of webpages that link to webpage i}$, and $N_j = \text{number of webpages that webpage j links to}$. In words, the PageRank of a webpage is the sum of the PageRank of all webpages that link to it, normalized by how many links each one gives out.

_FootballRank_ adapts this idea to Football, replacing webpages with teams and links with victories. The _FootballRank_ of $N$ teams will be represented by a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$. The _FootballRank_ of team $i$ is defined by the following equation

$$
x_i = (1 - \alpha) + \alpha \frac{1}{g_i} \sum_{j \in B_i} \frac{m_{ji}}{\theta_j} x_j
$$

where
* $\alpha \in (0,1)$
* $g_i = \text{the number of games played by team } i$
* $B_i = \text{the set of all teams defeated by team } i$
* $m_{ji} = \text{the margin of victory of team i over team j}$
* $\theta_j = \sum_{j \in \\{ k: j \in B_k \\}}$ m_{ji} = sum of margin of defeat for team $j$ across all its games

In orders, the _FootballRank_ of a team is the ssum of the _FootballRank_ of all teams that it defeated, normalized by the margin of victory relative to that witnessed by the losing team in all its other losses.
